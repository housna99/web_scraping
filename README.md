# web_scraping
This is a program that scrapes Indeed's website to extract data about jobs that contain the word "python".

I have used the "Beautiful Soup" library to achieve my goal.
To speed it up, I adjusted my code to run every 2 minutes. 
In addition, important information like the job title and the location is stored in a file.
